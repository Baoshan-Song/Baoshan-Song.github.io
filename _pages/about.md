Aloha! I am currently a Ph.D Candidate in [the IPNL lab](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/ipn-lab/us/index.html), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Dr. Li-Ta Hsu and Dr. Weisong Wen. I am also a visiting student in [the ARCO lab](https://arcolab.mcmaster.ca/?page_id=25), advised by Dr. Matthew Giamou. I received the matser's degree in Guidance, Navigation and Control in 2023 and the bachelorâ€™s degree in Navigation Engineering in 2020, both from Wuhan University, China.

My research interests include convex optimization (including semidefinite programming (SDP)), factor graph optimization (FGO) and their application on multi-sensor fusion navigation in urban areas. Both SDP and FGO are popular in robotic fields but lack more applications to navigation, such as satellite navigation in urban canyons. I am currently working on a certifiably optimal multi-sensor integrated navigation system. If you are interested in my research, please don't hesitate to contact with me. I am planning to construct a certifiable estimator and apply it to navigation for robots.

For more details, please refer to my [CV](../assets/SBS_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
