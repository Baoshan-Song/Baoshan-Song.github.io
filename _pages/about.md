I am currently a second year Ph.D student in [the Intelligent Positioning and Navigation Laboratory](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/ipn-lab/us/index.html), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Dr. Li-Ta Hsu and Dr. Weisong Wen. 

My research interests include convex optimization, factor graph optimization (FGO) and their application on multi-sensor fusion navigation in urban areas. 

For more details, please refer to my [CV](../assets/SBS_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
